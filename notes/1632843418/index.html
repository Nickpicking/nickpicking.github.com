<a  target="_blank" rel="external noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28514050">thoughts.page</a> on Hacker News, and I liked the simplicity of it, which is something I have experimented with before. I created an account, and promptly spawned my own 
<a  target="_blank" rel="external noopener" href="https://fastidious.thoughts.page">thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>Wanting more control, I went and grabbed the 
<a  target="_blank" rel="external noopener" href="https://github.com/thwidge/thoughts">script</a> that started it all, and quickly setup my own &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo;, calling them &ldquo;notes&rdquo;&mdash;because that is more accurate to what they are. Things seemed well, until I decided to tinker with formatting other than CSS. The little script, albeit simple, didn&rsquo;t really scale well. That&rsquo;s when I decided to use a static site generator to replace it, which bring me here. This now gets generated by 
<a  target="_blank" rel="external noopener" href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to work to import the old notes, and accept the old URLs, but it is going to take some time. For now, a fresh start.</p>
