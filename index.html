<div class="note-body"><p>Of all social media, Twitter is the only one I peruse, and occasionally tweet/re-tweet things. I would not mind&mdash;maybe&mdash;paying for <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">Twitter Blue</a> if a verified seal was part of it. Not just a stroke to my ego, but it would help spotting and isolating bots/trolls.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>And it is now completed. Next step is editing, but I will not need to test that, at least not here. Off to the road. An 18 degrees Sunday is too good of a day to stay indoors.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Tinkering for the night is over. Right now this little page is generated (and re-generated) using a little of AppleScript, and Automator. Not sure how scalable will it be, but for now it will have to do.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>It is going to be a challenge keeping this page short as I babble. I was thinking on submitting it to the <a href="https://250kb.club/">250KB club</a> for which right now qualifies but, for how long?</p></div>
