<div class="note-body"><p>Parents are going away for a couple of weeks, and I already miss them, and feel blue. Then I start thinking that I will not be around when my kid reaches my age, and that blue turns deep blue. Why are we build this way?</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Links to videos/sounds on YouTube are OK, because—for the most part—they work without anything extra. No need to login, they just play. Spotify is another story.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Implemented a basic light/dark “theme” to respect user’s settings. Try forcing your OS to light/dark, and take a look. Current colours are not final, but it is a step forward. I think.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Diablo’s III season 26 has started, and with it a little escape after a long working day. The thing I like about Diablo III is that there is little competition. You don’t feel like you are having a second job, or a second life, to move up the ladder. For me it is as casual as it can be.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>The list of blocked domains because they keep sending emails quoting previous ones they have sent—and not acknowledged—is growing big. Companies shouldn’t send UCE, but if they do, they should take a hint when there are no replies to them.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Of all social media, Twitter is the only one I peruse, and occasionally tweet/re-tweet things. I would not mind&mdash;maybe&mdash;paying for <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">Twitter Blue</a> if a verified seal was part of it.
