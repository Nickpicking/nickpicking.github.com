<div class="note-body"><p>Having an almost 300% overallocation of working time for projects isn’t fun. On top of it, having to train—at my own pace—myself on a myriad of subjects. Also not fun.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Using <a href="https://logseq.com">Logseq</a> for work—and soon for personal—has improved my, already good, organisational skills. It had had another good side effect: I seldom take paper notes anymore.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>After eating too many dishes with sticky rice yesterday, and feeling guilty about it, I decided to have a ham and cheese sandwich on black German bread, and a glass of naturally sweetened pineapple juice, as my only meal today.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Forget about being part of the 10KB club. Index page is now bigger than that without compression. It is impossible to do, unless the page has nothing in it.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a beast. Such a useful tool, I will donate to it.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Of all social media, Twitter is the only one I peruse, and occasionally tweet/re-tweet things. I would not mind&mdash;maybe&mdash;paying for <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">Twitter Blue</a> if a verified seal was part of it. Not just a stroke to my ego, but it would help spotting and isolating bots/trolls.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>And it is now completed. Next step is editing, but I will not need to test that, at least not here. Off to the road. An 18 degrees Sunday is too good of a day to stay indoors.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Further automating things. Now this little thing builds right after I exit the editor. Hopefully this boring development cycle will end soon.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Tinkering for the night is over. Right now this little page is generated (and re-generated) using a little of AppleScript, and Automator. Not sure how scalable will it be, but for now it will have to do.</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>It is going to be a challenge keeping this page short as I babble. I was thinking on submitting it to the <a href="https://250kb.club/">250KB club</a> for which right now qualifies but, for how long?</p></div>

<div class="note-body"><p>Giving this another try. Nothing better than a Saturday&mdash;or just a weekend, for that matter&mdash;for start overs. Using the opportunity to downsize too. Let us see.</p></div>
