<div class="note-body"><p>Went to Hotel Mum (mum&rsquo;s house, LOL), and took a shower. Oh, what a wonderful feeling! I would happily go one day, or more, without eating, but having a luxurious shower is priceless. Onto binging now!</p>

<div class="note-body"><p>It truly was a long day&mdash;started at 06:00, ended at 17:00&mdash;but now it is over. As I was ending my shift, and were almost dressed as I came to this world, I realised there was no water coming from the shower. Turns out there is an outage in my area 😩. Now I am tired, filthy, and itchy. Amanda, the nice representative at the utilities company, told me they don&rsquo;t have an estimate on when the water will flow once more.</p>
<p>Oh dear, oh dear.</p>

<div class="note-body"><p>Last working day of the week for me. Lots of things to do today, kinda overwhelming, but we can do this! Let&rsquo;s get it over with, and bask into doing nothing afterwards. Yes, it will be a staycation about nothing but&hellip; ain&rsquo;t that something?!</p>

<div class="note-body"><p>So, T-Mobile offers a free year of Paramount Plus. I go through the hoops, create my Paramount+ account, and add the T-Mo discount. It tells me I can cancel at any time, and that it will run until current subscription expires (which should be November 2022). I cancel because I don&rsquo;t want to forget and get charged due to my senility. What happens next, you ask? Well, I only have a week of subscription, nothing else. Oh, and I can&rsquo;t apply the coupon T-Mo gave me.</p>
<p>Thanks for nothing, T-Mo and Paramount!</p>

<div class="note-body"><p>Mum and dad need a new auto. Theirs is over 20 years old and, well, it&rsquo;s starting to tell them it had enought. It&rsquo;s doing so in very certain ways, ways it knows it hurts. Like breaking badly, and costing hundreds of notes for repairs.</p>

<div class="note-body"><p>Because I have come across this many times since the time changed last weekend: this is not daylight savings time, this is &ldquo;regular&rdquo; time. Daylight savings time is what we left behind&mdash;and what many, many, many agree we should stop using. We gained the hour we lost thanks to DST. So, screw DST! Clear now?</p>

<div class="note-body"><p>Final dump, or spam. AT&amp;T Fibre is coming this Thursday. Hopefully that latency, that slight delay that seems to take minutes, which get us killed (boom, head shot!) will stop. We simply can&rsquo;t keep up living&mdash;or dying&mdash;like this.</p>
