<pre><code class="block">git config user.name &quot;your-user-name&quot;
git config user.email &quot;your-email-addr&quot;
</code></pre>
And: <br>
<pre><code class="block">git config --global user.name &quot;your-user-name&quot;
git config --global user.email &quot;your-email-addr&quot;
</code></pre>
The first will apply to the current repository, the second to all. Local configuration bumps global. </div></section>
