      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this qualifies as a small speed bump, right? It is not much about speed, but latency. If it remains that low, it is certainly a mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to Hotel Mum (mum&amp;rsquo;s house, LOL), and took a shower. Oh, what a wonderful feeling! I would happily go one day, or more, without eating, but having a luxurious shower is priceless. Onto binging now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It truly was a long day&amp;mdash;started at 06:00, ended at 17:00&amp;mdash;but now it is over. As I was ending my shift, and were almost dressed as I came to this world, I realised there was no water coming from the shower. Turns out there is an outage in my area 😩. Now I am tired, filthy, and itchy. Amanda, the nice representative at the utilities company, told me they don&amp;rsquo;t have an estimate on when the water will flow once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear, oh dear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upgrading these HPE servers firmware is like watching slow drying paint dry. A total, royal, pain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last working day of the week for me. Lots of things to do today, kinda overwhelming, but we can do this! Let&amp;rsquo;s get it over with, and bask into doing nothing afterwards. Yes, it will be a staycation about nothing but&amp;hellip; ain&amp;rsquo;t that something?!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so confussed with the RSS generation on this little experiment here. On Reeder, it only shows the title, no description. That is not the way it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, T-Mobile offers a free year of Paramount Plus. I go through the hoops, create my Paramount+ account, and add the T-Mo discount. It tells me I can cancel at any time, and that it will run until current subscription expires (which should be November 2022). I cancel because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget and get charged due to my senility. What happens next, you ask? Well, I only have a week of subscription, nothing else. Oh, and I can&amp;rsquo;t apply the coupon T-Mo gave me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for nothing, T-Mo and Paramount!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mum and dad need a new auto. Theirs is over 20 years old and, well, it&amp;rsquo;s starting to tell them it had enought. It&amp;rsquo;s doing so in very certain ways, ways it knows it hurts. Like breaking badly, and costing hundreds of notes for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I have come across this many times since the time changed last weekend: this is not daylight savings time, this is &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; time. Daylight savings time is what we left behind&amp;mdash;and what many, many, many agree we should stop using. We gained the hour we lost thanks to DST. So, screw DST! Clear now?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Final dump, or spam. AT&amp;amp;T Fibre is coming this Thursday. Hopefully that latency, that slight delay that seems to take minutes, which get us killed (boom, head shot!) will stop. We simply can&amp;rsquo;t keep up living&amp;mdash;or dying&amp;mdash;like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;If wisdom ways you wisely seek, five things observe with care:&lt;br&gt;
to whom you speak, of whom you speak, and how, when and where.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ain&amp;rsquo;t that the truth! Though some people, and even ourselves, sometimes simply don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A four days weekend approaches. Yet, as I have done before&amp;mdash;and will do many, hopefully, times again&amp;mdash;I will have to mow the lawn, and do other secular chores, as always. It never ends! Well, it does, but we don&amp;rsquo;t really like it when it does.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are, and here we go again. Nothing lasts forever. Nothing I do lasts for more than a month. So, here I am with the hopes this one will last longer, like, maybe two months? Anyway, cheers to a new beginning!&lt;/p&gt;
