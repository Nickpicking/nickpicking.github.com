      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have added the simple ability to reply to notes, by clicking on the note&amp;rsquo;s subject. I will pin this note for a little bit, so that it remain fresh for a while. I am not expecting replies, but being able to so is here now, in case one is merited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note&amp;rsquo;s permalink can still be found on the date, and on the Note-ID.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2021-12-03 - 13:00:47-0500</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that we are enjoying faster Internet connectivity speeds we have come to realise our Google WiFi mesh doesn&amp;rsquo;t really cut it. Even though we have four mesh devices, each with direct line of sight to each other, we are getting &amp;ldquo;weak connection&amp;rdquo; amongst them. We are also, almost constantly, connecting to the 2.4 GHz band instead of the faster 5 GHz one, and there is no way to control that on the devices themselves. In other words, and in plain English: they suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am looking to buy an enterprise grade WiFi router and mesh. Everything I have found requires cabling&amp;mdash;which is the obvious on an enterprise, but not in our non-CAT-X wired home. Hence, we are bound to consumer products. Any recommendations? I am eyeballing &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.amplifi.com/products/amplifi-alien-router-mesh&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://shop.asus.com/us/rog/90ig03s1-ba1g0v-rog-rapture-gt-ac5300.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;on this one I will need to add a mesh&amp;mdash;but not quite decided yet. I have been reading a lot, but reviews can be so misleading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know, first world problems. 😔&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would the simplest, and easiest way to style a blockquote on CSS be, so that it mimics the &amp;ldquo;old style&amp;rdquo; email reply quoting? Something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; This is a sentence here, that &lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; looks like a quoted reply.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; And this is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ponder, I ponder, while looking Down Under&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have missed tea at mum&amp;rsquo;s for the last two days, because I have been going to visit, and taken care of, dad at the hospital. He is now home, and well, so&amp;hellip; missing tea no more. Off to shower, and to tea!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a real test of sorts, but I am not sure how will it work, or if it will work as I want. The idea is to write notes mimicking an email. I am not quite there yet, but getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the episode &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spongebob.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sponge_Who_Could_Fly&#34;&gt;The Sponge who could fly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, a nugget of wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t need a plane to fly, plastic wings may make you cry&lt;br&gt;
Kites are made for windy days, lawn chairs with balloons fly away&lt;br&gt;
Inflatable pants you may as well skip&lt;br&gt;
If you want to fly, all you need is friendship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants, always wise. So much to learn for him!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this qualifies as a small speed bump, right? It is not much about speed, but latency. If it remains that low, it is certainly a mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went to Hotel Mum (mum&amp;rsquo;s house, LOL), and took a shower. Oh, what a wonderful feeling! I would happily go one day, or more, without eating, but having a luxurious shower is priceless. Onto binging now!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It truly was a long day&amp;mdash;started at 06:00, ended at 17:00&amp;mdash;but now it is over. As I was ending my shift, and were almost dressed as I came to this world, I realised there was no water coming from the shower. Turns out there is an outage in my area 😩. Now I am tired, filthy, and itchy. Amanda, the nice representative at the utilities company, told me they don&amp;rsquo;t have an estimate on when the water will flow once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear, oh dear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upgrading these HPE servers firmware is like watching slow drying paint dry. A total, royal, pain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last working day of the week for me. Lots of things to do today, kinda overwhelming, but we can do this! Let&amp;rsquo;s get it over with, and bask into doing nothing afterwards. Yes, it will be a staycation about nothing but&amp;hellip; ain&amp;rsquo;t that something?!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am so confussed with the RSS generation on this little experiment here. On Reeder, it only shows the title, no description. That is not the way it is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, T-Mobile offers a free year of Paramount Plus. I go through the hoops, create my Paramount+ account, and add the T-Mo discount. It tells me I can cancel at any time, and that it will run until current subscription expires (which should be November 2022). I cancel because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget and get charged due to my senility. What happens next, you ask? Well, I only have a week of subscription, nothing else. Oh, and I can&amp;rsquo;t apply the coupon T-Mo gave me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for nothing, T-Mo and Paramount!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mum and dad need a new auto. Theirs is over 20 years old and, well, it&amp;rsquo;s starting to tell them it had enought. It&amp;rsquo;s doing so in very certain ways, ways it knows it hurts. Like breaking badly, and costing hundreds of notes for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I have come across this many times since the time changed last weekend: this is not daylight savings time, this is &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; time. Daylight savings time is what we left behind&amp;mdash;and what many, many, many agree we should stop using. We gained the hour we lost thanks to DST. So, screw DST! Clear now?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Final dump, or spam. AT&amp;amp;T Fibre is coming this Thursday. Hopefully that latency, that slight delay that seems to take minutes, which get us killed (boom, head shot!) will stop. We simply can&amp;rsquo;t keep up living&amp;mdash;or dying&amp;mdash;like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;If wisdom ways you wisely seek, five things observe with care:&lt;br&gt;
to whom you speak, of whom you speak, and how, when and where.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ain&amp;rsquo;t that the truth! Though some people, and even ourselves, sometimes simply don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A four days weekend approaches. Yet, as I have done before&amp;mdash;and will do many, hopefully, times again&amp;mdash;I will have to mow the lawn, and do other secular chores, as always. It never ends! Well, it does, but we don&amp;rsquo;t really like it when it does.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are, and here we go again. Nothing lasts forever. Nothing I do lasts for more than a month. So, here I am with the hopes this one will last longer, like, maybe two months? Anyway, cheers to a new beginning!&lt;/p&gt;
